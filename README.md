PythonExternalProgramTestFramework
==================================

Python Test Framework for External Program Commands

TODO:
- Description, usage, explanation
- Demo page
- Overall suite timeout and total suite time 
- Logging options for framework output, disabled for now, maybe just write to suite name file and keep separate from process output
- Test with longer output, something with more error output, crash
- Custom case setup, teardown, post test function
- Allow manual setting of pass fail if want to do a check in post test function or teardown
- Skip test, skip suite decorator 
- take a list of commands/arguments to allow exeution of multiple external programs in the same test case
